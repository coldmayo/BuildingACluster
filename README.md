This is a Repo on notes taken to build a Beowulf cluster (and make BPS pay the electricity bill)

Take a look at [[Notes on Relevant Intro To HPC Chapters]] to see some notes from the relevant chapters from the Intro to HPC textbook

The [[Building a home HPC]] file shows what we need/how everything fits together

[[Products]] has links for online listing of parts we need

There is also a Pricing.ods file which shows approximately how much everything should cost.
